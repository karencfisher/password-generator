# password-generator
A (hopefully) reasonably secure method to generate repeatable cryptic passwords

Making and (above all) remembering arcane passwords (random sequences of 20 upper and lower case 
letters, numbers, symbols) is always perplexing. Wouldn't be nice if we could use idiosyncratic phrases 
we could remember? That we can turn those into hard passwords, and be able to re-generate them at
anytime?

That's what this application is about.

## Setup

Simplest: download the .exe in the dist folder.

Or, one can clone and/or fork this repo.
